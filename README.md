# SendInput-wrapper
A wrapper class for the winapi function SendInput

Currently a work in progress, I hope to make this wrapper class a versatile and useful tool.

Things to work on: 
  Adding parsing for virtual key codes such as VK_OEM1, VK_OEM2, etc
  Creating more flexibility and ease of access with configs
